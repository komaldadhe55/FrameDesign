A printer is a device that transfers text and images from a computer to paper or other materials. 
Printers can be connected to a computer directly or indirectly through a network. 

They come in many different types, including: 

Inkjet printers: The most common type of personal printer, which sprays ink onto paper. Inkjet printers can be slower than laser printers 
and ink cartridges can be expensive if you print a lot. 

Laser printers: Use a laser beam to create high-quality prints on a drum. 
Color laser printers: Often used in professional settings. 

Thermal printers: Use heated pins or wax-based ink to imprint images on special paper. 

3D printers: Create physical objects from digital files. 

Dot matrix printers: A low-cost option that strikes the paper one line at a time. 

Printers can also be classified as impact or non-impact printers.
