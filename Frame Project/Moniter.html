Monitor belongs to the category of output devices. It is a hardware device which is used to display output.
The monitor can display all the graphics and information to the user through the video card. In traditional desktop computers,
separate monitors are connected to the other devices with the help of cables. In laptops and tablets, the monitor is built. 
The monitor is similar to a TV but has a higher resolution.

Working Principle of Monitor
Monitor works by using pixels to display the information. These are nothing but tiny dots that emit light. When the monitor receives electrical signals from any other source 
like for instance the video card that sends video signals, these signals are processed by the monitor and each pixel is illuminated using display technology.
The color of each pixel is also determined after processing of signals. The internal circuit of the monitor control the pixelâ€™s brightness and the user can see the images,
videos and other outputs on the screen.

Types of Monitor

The different types of monitor are as shown below:

1) Cathode Ray Tube Monitors: are those monitors that were used in earlier versions of computer. They are heavier and consume more energy. These monitors produce images through manipulation of electronic beams.
2) LCD: stands for Liquid Crystal Display. These monitors are thinner as compared to Cathode Ray Tubes. They have higher resolution, consume less energy and take up less space.
3) LED: stands for Light Emitting Diode. As the name suggests it uses light emitting diode for backlighting. LED Monitor provides upto 4K resolution and is much more environment friendly as it consumes less energy.
4) OLED: It stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. It uses organic materials to convert electronic current to light. Organic materials include wood, plastic, polymers etc. These monitors are foldable as compared to traditional LCD or LED. 
   It is thinner and is excellent for watching movies. However its lifespan is very less and are expensive.

Advantages of Monitor:

<ul>
<li>Energy Consumption: Nowadays, the LCDs and LEDs consume very less energy as compared to other machines. This helps the companies to maintain their budget.</li>
<li>Resolution: Monitors provide high resolutions. Some monitors are capable of providing resolution up to 4K that are suitable for gaming, watching movies, videos, editing etc.</li>
<li>Designs: Nowadays monitors have lightweight and sleek designs that allows users to place their monitors anywhere. Nowadays with the introduction of laptops and tablets, users can use it anytime anywhere.</li>
</ul>

Disadvantages of Monitor:

<ul>
<li>Expensive: Although monitors provide high resolution, these monitors are very expensive. Specially LCD, OLED are expensive and individuals cannot afford to purchase.</li>
<li>Environmental Pollution: Disposing of monitors is a serious issue as they contribute to electronic waste. These wastes are difficult to recycle.</li>
<li>Emission of Blue Light: Monitors emit a large amount of blue light which causes serious eye problems to individuals.</li>
</ul>
