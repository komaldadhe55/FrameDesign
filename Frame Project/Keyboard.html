   A keyboard is an input device that allows users to type letters, numbers, and symbols into a computer or other electronic device. When a key is pressed, 
    it sends an electrical signal to the computer's processor, which then interprets the signal and displays the corresponding letter or symbol on the screen.
    Keyboards are usually arranged in a specific layout, such as QWERTY or DVORAK, and have evolved to accommodate different characters and symbols used 
    in different countries and languages. 
    
    Keyboards have many different types of keys, including: 

    1) Control keys
    These keys, such as Ctrl, Alt, and Esc, can perform specific actions when used in 
    combination with other keys. For example, they can be used to copy and paste text, 
    switch between applications, or issue commands within software programs. 
    
    2) Navigation keys
    These keys, such as the arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up, Page Down, Delete, and Insert, 
    are used for moving around in documents or webpages and editing text. 
    
    3) Special purpose keys
    These keys include Enter, Shift, Caps Lock, Num Lock, Space bar, Tab, and Print Screen. 
    For example, the Caps Lock key changes the case of the letters you type, so that all letters 
    are in uppercase when it's activated. The Delete key is used to delete the character ahead of 
    or beneath the cursor in text mode,or the currently-selected object in GUI mode.
